Hereâ€™s a simplified table explaining the use of articles ("a," "an," and "the") for 7th-grade students, along with examples:

| **Article** | **When to Use**                                                                 | **Examples**                          |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **a**       | Use "a" before words that begin with a consonant sound.                        | a cat, a dog, a book, a university (sounds like "yoo") |
| **an**      | Use "an" before words that begin with a vowel sound (a, e, i, o, u).          | an apple, an elephant, an hour (silent "h"), an honor (silent "h") |
| **the**     | Use "the" when talking about something specific or already mentioned.          | the cat (a specific cat), the book on the table, the sun (one specific sun) |

### Summary
- **"a"**: Use before consonant sounds.

### More Examples

This table should help 7th graders understand how to use articles correctly with clear examples!
