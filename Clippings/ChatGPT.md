ShadCN UI is a collection of beautifully styled, accessible, and customizable components built on top of Radix UI and Tailwind CSS. It is mainly used in React projects to quickly build user interfaces.

---

## **How to Use ShadCN UI in Your React Project**

### **Step 1: Install a New React App (If Not Already)**

If you donâ€™t have a React project yet, create one using Vite or Next.js.

For **Vite + React**:

```sh
shbun create vite@latest my-app --template react
cd my-app
```

For **Next.js**:

```sh
shbun create next@latest my-app
cd my-app
```

> You can also use `npx create-next-app@latest my-app` if using npm.

---

### **Step 2: Install ShadCN UI**

Run the following command inside your project folder:

```sh
shbun dlx shadcn-ui@latest init
```

Or for npm:

```sh
shnpx shadcn-ui@latest init
```

This will ask for some configurations, such as:

- Framework: **Next.js / Vite**
- Alias for `@shadcn/ui`: You can keep the default.
- Tailwind CSS: It will detect if Tailwind is installed.

If you donâ€™t have **Tailwind CSS** installed, it will help you set it up.

---

### **Step 3: Install a Component**

To install a component (e.g., Button):

```sh
shbun dlx shadcn-ui@latest add button
```

For npm:

```sh
shnpx shadcn-ui@latest add button
```

---

### **Step 4: Use the Component in Your App**

After installation, you can import and use it in your React components:

```tsx
tsximport { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div className="flex items-center justify-center min-h-screen">
      <Button variant="default">Click Me</Button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

---

## **Additional Notes**

- ShadCN UI stores components locally in your `components/ui` folder.
- You can customize components easily by modifying the files.
- It works best with **Next.js**, but you can configure it for Vite.
