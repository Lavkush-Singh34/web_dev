To revert your working directory to the latest commit ( `07649785ac3e3a2715a8eb819038dce42b9e6c2a` ), use:

```bash
bashgit reset --hard HEAD
```

If you have untracked files that you also want to remove, run:

```bash
bashgit clean -fd
```

If you want to reset to the latest commit and ensure everything is fresh, you can also run:

```bash
bashgit reset --hard origin/main
```

(Only if you are working with a remote repository and want to reset to the latest version from there.)

Be careful! The `--hard` option will discard all uncommitted changes. If you need to keep them, use `git stash` first:

```bash
bashgit stash
```
