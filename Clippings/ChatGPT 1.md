This warning means that some of your JavaScript bundles are larger than **500 kB** after minification, which could lead to slower loading times in production. Here’s what you can do to optimize it:

### 🔹 **Why does this happen?**

- Your **`dist/assets/index-ZGVYjgIp.js`** file is **554.03 kB**, exceeding the 500 kB limit.
- Large chunks can slow down page load times, especially on slower networks.

### ✅ **Possible Solutions**

#### 1️⃣ **Enable Code-Splitting (Dynamic Import)**

Instead of loading everything in a single large bundle, **split** your JavaScript files:

```js
jsimport('./SomeLargeComponent').then((module) => {
  const SomeLargeComponent = module.default;
});
```

This ensures that only necessary code is loaded initially.

#### 2️⃣ **Manually Split Chunks (Rollup Config)**

Modify `vite.config.js` to configure **Rollup's manualChunks**:

```js
jsexport default defineConfig({
  build: {
    rollupOptions: {
      output: {
        manualChunks: (id) => {
          if (id.includes('node_modules')) {
            return 'vendor'; // Moves third-party dependencies to vendor.js
          }
        },
      },
    },
  },
});
```

This creates separate chunks for **third-party libraries** (like React, lodash, etc.), reducing the main bundle size.

#### 3️⃣ **Increase the Chunk Size Warning Limit**

If you’re sure the large file is necessary, you can **increase the warning limit** in `vite.config.js`:

```js
jsexport default defineConfig({
  build: {
    chunkSizeWarningLimit: 1000, // Set to 1000 KB (1MB) to avoid warnings
  },
});
```

⚠ **Note:** This doesn’t reduce the file size—it just removes the warning.

#### 4️⃣ **Optimize Dependencies**

Check if some packages are unnecessarily bundled. Run:

to see what’s making the bundle so large.
