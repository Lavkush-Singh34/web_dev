It looks like your Vite build process isn't including your images in the final build. This is likely happening because the images in your src/assets directory aren't being properly imported and referenced in your code.

Here are some possible solutions:

1. **Check how you're importing images**: Make sure you're importing images in your components with the correct relative paths. In React with Vite, you should import images directly in your component files:

```jsx
jsximport myImage from '../assets/globe-logo.jpg'

function MyComponent() {
  return <img src={myImage} alt="Globe Logo" />
}
```

2. **Move images to public folder**: Files in the `public` directory are copied as-is to the build output. You could move your images there and reference them with absolute paths:

```jsx
jsxfunction MyComponent() {
  return <img src="/assets/globe-logo.jpg" alt="Globe Logo" />
}
```

3. **Check your vite.config.js**: Make sure it doesn't have any configurations that might be excluding image files. You might want to add explicit handling for image assets:

```jsx
jsx// vite.config.js
export default {
  assetsInclude: ['**/*.jpg', '**/*.png', '**/*.webp', '**/*.avif', '**/*.jpeg', '**/*.svg']
}
```

4. **Try adding `--debug` flag** to your build command to see more details:

5. **Check CSS background images**: If you're using CSS background images, make sure you're using the correct syntax for Vite:

```css
css.my-element {
  background-image: url('@/assets/globe-logo.jpg');
}
```

Would you like me to help troubleshoot any specific component where images aren't appearing?
