You can check which DNS servers your Arch Linux system is using with the following methods:

### 1\. **Check `resolv.conf` (Traditional Method)**

Run:

```sh
shcat /etc/resolv.conf
```

This will show the DNS servers your system is using. If you see something like `nameserver 127.0.0.53`, your system is using a local resolver like `systemd-resolved`.

---

### 2\. **Check systemd-resolved (If Enabled)**

If you are using `systemd-resolved`, run:

```sh
shresolvectl status
```

or

```sh
shsystemd-resolve --status
```

Look under the `DNS Servers` section.

If your system is using `systemd-resolved`, the actual DNS servers might not be directly in `/etc/resolv.conf`, but instead managed by `resolvectl`.

---

### 3\. **Check NetworkManager (If Installed)**

If you are using NetworkManager, run:

```sh
shnmcli dev show | grep DNS
```

This will list the DNS servers assigned to your network interfaces.

---

### 4\. **Check Active Connections**

For a more detailed view, use:

```sh
grep "nameserver" /etc/resolv.conf
```

or check the DNS settings for a specific interface (like `wlan0` or `eth0`):

```sh
nmcli device show wlan0 | grep DNS
```

(Replace `wlan0` with your active network interface.)

---

### 5\. **Check DNS Used by the System**

To verify which DNS is actually being used for queries:

```sh
dig google.com
```

or

```sh
nslookup google.com
```

This will show which DNS server is resolving queries.

Let me know if you need help modifying the DNS settings! ðŸš€
