To stop a GitHub Codespace from the terminal, follow these steps:

### 1\. **Using `gh` CLI (Recommended)**

GitHub provides the `gh` CLI, which allows you to manage Codespaces easily.

#### **Step 1: Ensure the `gh` CLI is installed**

If you haven't installed it yet, install it using:

- **Arch Linux:**
```sh
shsudo pacman -S github-cli
```
- **Other Linux/macOS:**
```sh
shcurl -fsSL https://cli.github.com/install.sh | sh
```

#### **Step 2: Authenticate with GitHub**

Run:

```sh
shgh auth login
```

and follow the prompts.

#### **Step 3: List running Codespaces**

```sh
shgh codespace list
```

This will display all your active Codespaces along with their names.

#### **Step 4: Stop a specific Codespace**

```sh
shgh codespace stop -c <codespace-name>
```

Replace `<codespace-name>` with the actual name from the list.

### 2\. **Using `GitHub Codespaces Web Interface`**

1. Go to **[GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces)**.
2. Find your active Codespace.
3. Click **Stop**.
