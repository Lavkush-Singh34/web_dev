Yes! You can use JavaScript to prompt the user for their name and dynamically insert it into the WhatsApp message. Here's how you can do it:

```html
html<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>WhatsApp Dummy Message</title>
  <script>
    function sendMessage() {
      let userName = prompt("Please enter your name:");
      if (userName) {
        let message = encodeURIComponent(\`Hello, I am ${userName}\`);
        let phoneNumber = "+918127173818"; // Replace with your number
        let whatsappUrl = \`https://wa.me/${phoneNumber}?text=${message}\`;
        window.open(whatsappUrl, "_blank");
      }
    }
  </script>
</head>
<body>
  <button onclick="sendMessage()">WhatsApp me</button>
</body>
</html>
```

### How it works:

1. When the button is clicked, `sendMessage()` function runs.
2. It asks the user to enter their name using `prompt()`.
3. The name is inserted into the WhatsApp message dynamically.
4. The message is encoded using `encodeURIComponent()` to ensure it works in a URL.
5. Finally, the WhatsApp chat opens with the pre-filled message.

This makes the message more personalized! ðŸŽ‰ Let me know if you need any modifications. ðŸš€
